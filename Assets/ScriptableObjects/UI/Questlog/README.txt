To create a new quest:

1. Navigate to Assets/ScriptableObjects/UI/Questlog
2. In the Questlog folder, right click in the project window > Create
   > Questing > Quest
3. Name the newly created quest the exact name you want
4. Select the quest object and in the inspector give it the EXACT same
   quest name that you gave the object itself
5. Fill out the quest description
6. TODO!!!! The required quest items and quest rewards do not have any
   functionality just yet due to the lack of items implemented thus far
7. Once the quest object is done, in the inspector, click on prefabs >
   UI > QuestLog > QuestLogPanel
8. Increase the list of quests by the amount of quests you want to add
   and then drag the quest objects into the list

NOTICE: PLEASE DO THIS ON THE PREFAB SO IT SAVES EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE!!!
