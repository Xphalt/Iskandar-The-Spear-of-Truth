  description: 'This armour will make it so the player is immune to the environmental
    hazards of the forest biome. The venom spitters will still do damage on hit to
    the player but the poison component of the attack will no longer apply. Additionally
    whenever an enemies hitbox collides with the players the enemy takes some damage
    to represent them colliding with Armour of Black Thorns. A variable will be need
    for the HP damage when a player comes into contact with venom spitter hazards. '
