  description: "This armour will make it so the player is immune to the environmental
    hazards in the desert biome, however the player can still fall into the pitfalls,
    but they no longer take damage for doing so. The Antlions that would appear in
    the sand traps won\u2019t appear and the player's movement is no longer impacted
    by the sand traps and can manoeuvre over them freely. Additionally when wearing
    this armour the I frames from the dash/dodge will be increased(If this makes
    it too easy for the player to avoid damage i will think of a replacement effect.) "
